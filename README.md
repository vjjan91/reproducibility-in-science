## Reproducible Scientific Practices for Conservation Biologists and Ecologists

This repository was initially created to collate materials for a workshop on Reproducible Scientific Practices for Conservation Biologists at the Student Conference in Conservation Science, New York.  

### Pre-workshop instructions  

1. Please bring your own device, preferably with [R/RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) installed.  
2. Create a account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) - it's free!. Please note that when you are creating a GitHub account for the first time, I would recommend that you _do not_ click the 'Continue with Google' option and instead manually enter your email address, set a password and username. Else, if you used one of your gmail addresses automatically, please ensure that you set a password for your account.      
3. Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). 

Besides the above three steps, you do not need to do anything else. We will do the rest during the workshop!

### Workshop details  

The first part of the workshop will focus on the necessity for reproducible approaches in conservation biology, followed by an introduction to data management, organization, and file naming conventions.  

The second half of the workshop will be focused on version control, GitHub and using it with RStudio.  

Towards the end, we will go over useful resources and functionality from packages that are commonly used.
