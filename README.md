## Reproducible Scientific Practices for Conservation Biologists and Ecologists

This repository was initially created to collate materials for a workshop on Reproducible Scientific Practices for Conservation Biologists at the Student Conference in Conservation Science, New York


Notes from discussions with Natalie Cooper:

Intro to open science, why it matters, why people should engage for altruistic and selfish reasons (ie 90% of the time the person reusing your code is you in 6 months time!)

File naming and project organisation (very brief)

Git. What it is. How the workflow works. Setting it up on RStudio and linking it to GitHub - this is a slog because it takes time for people to set up 2FA etc BUT I find it's worth us going through it slowly so everyone has a working set up. We follow the set up in https://happygitwithr.com/ if you've got reasonably tech savvy folk attending you could get them to set this up before the workshop. People here are a bit of a mixture of levels so I do it with them.

Quarto - basics plus inserting memes and gifs because it's fun. I then get them to use to Git plus GitHub workflows as they update their document. I also cover revert and going back to older versions.

Collaboration with Git and GitHub. In pairs they fork and edit the other persons Quarto adding a new meme/gif and then send a pull request. This often gets a bit messy but is fun. 

Preparing to publish - we talk about editing the GitHub readme, adding package details, checkpoint, getting zenodo dois, licenses etc
we then run through the workflow again from start of project to end to show how it all fits together
